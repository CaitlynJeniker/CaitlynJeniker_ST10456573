Step 1: Open Android Studio.

If you don't have Android Studio installed, you can download it from the official website and follow the installation instructions.

Step 2: Create a New Project.

Click on "Start a new Android Studio project" or select "File" > "New" > "New Project".
Choose "Empty Activity" as the template for your project and click "Next".
Fill in the details like name, package name, and location for your project, then click "Finish".

Step 3: Design Layouts for Each Page.

Open the res folder in the project structure, then layout folder.
Create two layout files for each page. Right-click on layout folder > "New" > "Layout resource file".
Name the layout files for the first page (e.g., activity_main.xml) and the second page (e.g., activity_second_page.xml).
Design each layout using XML to add desired UI components like buttons, text views, etc.

Step 4: Implement Activities.

Open the MainActivity.kt file.
Define the layout for the first page in onCreate() method using setContentView(R.layout.activity_main).

Similarly, open the SecondPage.kt file and set the layout for the second page in onCreate() method using setContentView(R.layout.activity_second_page).

three buttons will appear- feed, clean and happy, so if u click on the each button a image will show corresponding to the button.

Step 5: Link the Pages.

In MainActivity.kt, add an Intent to navigate from the first page to the second page. This typically happens in response to a button click.
In activity_main.xml, add a button and define an onClick attribute to trigger the navigation when clicked.
Similarly, you can implement navigation from the second page back to the first page using an Intent.

Step 6: Run the App.

Connect your Android device or use an emulator.
Click on the "Run" button (usually a green triangle) to build and run your app.
Follow the on-screen instructions to select your device or emulator and run the app.
You should see your app launch, allowing you to navigate between the two pages.
enjoy!!!
